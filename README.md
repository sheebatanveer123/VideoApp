# VideoApp

#Overview
The VideoFeedApp is designed to deliver a vertically scrolling short-form video feed, inspired
by platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. It provides users with a seamless,
high-performance viewing experience where each video plays automatically, loops
continuously, and transitions smoothly as users swipe up or down. The architecture focuses
on efficiency, memory safety, and responsiveness to maintain a 60fps performance standard.

#Architecture Approach
The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern using SwiftUI for the
declarative UI layer and AVFoundation for media playback. The data model handles fetching
and decoding the video manifest, while the ViewModel manages playback state, preloading,
and resource cleanup. Views are designed using SwiftUI’s ScrollView and LazyVStack for
efficient layout and lazy loading of video content. UIKit’s AVPlayerLayer is wrapped through
UIViewRepresentable to provide hardware-accelerated rendering within SwiftUI.

#Design Decisions and Trade-offs
The app combines SwiftUI and UIKit for optimal balance between modern UI patterns and
mature video rendering. AVPlayer instances are managed through a PlayerPool, which
reuses only a limited number of players to prevent memory spikes. Gesture velocity detection
is custom implemented to provide more natural scrolling behavior similar to TikTok. Using
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) ensures adaptive bitrate selection for smooth playback on
varying network speeds.

#Memory Management
AVPlayer resources are reused across cells through a PlayerPool, reducing memory churn.
When a video scrolls off-screen, its player is paused and released from active memory.
SwiftUI’s LazyVStack ensures that only visible and nearby cells are instantiated. The
ViewModel uses weak references where appropriate to prevent retain cycles and ensures
background tasks run on non-main queues.

#Smooth Transitions Strategy
The app preloads upcoming videos and begins buffering before they appear on screen,
ensuring instant playback. Playback readiness is verified before advancing to the next video
to eliminate black frames. Gesture velocity is used to determine whether to move one or
multiple videos per swipe, making transitions feel fluid. Looping playback is implemented
using AVPlayer observers, ensuring continuous playback without interruption. All transitions
are optimized to minimize layout recomputation and UI thread load.

#Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include enhanced network resilience with retry and offline caching, a
buffering indicator for unready videos, and an adaptive prefetch mechanism that adjusts
buffer strategy based on network quality. Additional plans include integrating analytics to
measure engagement metrics such as watch duration and scroll velocity.

#Summary
The VideoFeedApp architecture is designed to be lightweight, modular, and performant. It
emphasizes real-time responsiveness, memory efficiency, and clean separation of concerns.
The result is a smooth, responsive video feed experience suitable for large-scale deployment,
offering an optimal balance of modern SwiftUI design and low-level AVFoundation
performance.
